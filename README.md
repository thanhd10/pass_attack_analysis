**Inferring Password Properties based on Zero-Permission Smartphone Sensors**

*Internet of Things 2021 - University of Oulu*

This project was created as part of the Internet of Things 2021 course at the University of Oulu. 
As part of this project, a proof of concept was developed to show that freely accessible motion sensors built into smartphones, 
such as the gyroscope and accelerometer, can reveal sensitive information about passwords. 
Here, it is shown that corresponding patterns emerge within the sensor data when corresponding buttons are tapped. 
In particular, it is shown here that the number of keys entered can be derived.
Furthermore, it may also be possible to determine whether an entered key is located on the left or right side of a keyboard.

This repository provides very simple analysis of generated patterns, when typing into a numbers-only textfield.
